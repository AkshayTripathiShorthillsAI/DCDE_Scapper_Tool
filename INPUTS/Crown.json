      "Stack Pallets for Space Savings",
      "When compared with counterbalance forklifts, Crown pallet stackers allow you to stack more products in the same size room by narrowing the required aisle width, which translates into more usable space while optimizing selectivity.",
      "Crown electric stackers are efficient, require less maintenance and avoid pollutants, fuel cost and engine noise.",
      "Take Control",
      "You need exceptional control to meet the challenges of efficiently moving and storing product in limited space. The innovative controls and compact design of the M Series electric walkie stacker enables operators to maneuver with ease.",
      "The exclusive Crown X10 Handle with its uniquely designed handgrip, thumbwheel and raise / lower buttons, simplifies operation and enhances comfort. When maneuvering a load, the position speed control enables operators to move the handle in near vertical position while engaging traction at creep speed. When operating in tight spaces with the handle completely vertical, the vertical tiller drive function allows for fine-tuned positioning.",
      "Operators can quickly and conveniently choose from two levels of programmable performance to match their own skill level or the particular application needs.",
      "Reliable, Lasting Value",
      "Crown builds long-term value into all of its lift trucks and the M Series walkie straddle stacker is no exception.",
      "Durability is evident inside and out. The frame, mast and outriggers feature generous amounts of steel for long life and a steel power unit cover to protect internal components. The control handle is made of high-grade aluminum and benefits from structural webbing for maximum strength and durability.",
